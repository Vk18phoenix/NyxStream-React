name: Deploy NyxStream Vite App to GitHub Pages

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch (usually 'main' or 'master')
  push:
    branches: ["main"] # Change to your default branch if different

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
# NOTE: If repo default is read-only, this is needed. If repo default allows write, it's good practice.
permissions:
  contents: read # Needed for checkout
  pages: write   # Needed to deploy to gh-pages branch via action typically
  id-token: write # Needed for some deployment methods / OIDC

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
